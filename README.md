# CNN Implementation for Hand Gesture Recognition on MAX78000 Feather Board

This project focuses on implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for hand gesture recognition using Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) signals. The goal is to recognize gestures using data acquired from the sensor and sent via serial communication to the MAX78000 Feather Board. The project was initially developed using TensorFlow and later PyTorch was adopted due to its extensive support and flexibility on the MAX78000 Feather Board.
